# FinalGame
This is my CS12 Final Game


A summary of the project goals
  
  For this project, we needed to create a game using all of the things that we had learned during the semester. One of the many goals that I created for myself was to make a game that allowed me to show off my skills but not make it too difficult for me to finish it.  The other goal that I created for myself was to make the game so that it was not hard, but also not so easy that it was not fun to play. 
  
Instructions the player may need
 
  
  For this game, you have to shoot as many zombies as you can before time runs out. With that said use the arrow keys to move and A and D on the keyboard to rotate to soldier. The space bar is how you shoot a single bullet and X is how u do a burst of bullets. If you let the zombies touch you, you will lose a life. You start with five lives once you lose all of them the game is over.

  For me, this project was not necessarily too hard but I did have challenges completing this. One of the main things that I learned was to not bite off more than I can chew. One of the main things that I learned from this project is that things do not always go as planned and that it's usually something small that needs to be fixed in my code. One thing I did get stuck on was the leaderboard. More specifically filling in the scores on the leader board. I was not able to fully figure out how to place the scores on the labels for the leaderboard. One thing I would do differently next time I spend less time on the aesthetics and more time on the leaderboard and go to office hours once or twice. I would like to improve more at the start of the game. giving the player more time to react to the zombies. Being that I was not able to finish the leaderboard that is the on this I ended up straying away from my game design. Using my love for game design and my constant love for a new challenge is how I was able to be able to stay on track.
